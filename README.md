## Notes

* The app does not currently support downloading talks for offline playing.
* Access to retreatants only talks is not currently supported.

These talks are freely offered in the spirit of dana, or generosity. You may visit the Dharma Seed website if you would like to support our work. We are a small non-profit organization supported solely through donations and we deeply appreciate your help in making these priceless teachings available to all.

Operating since the early 1980's, Dharma Seed collects and distributes dharma talks by teachers transmitting the Vipassana or Insight practices of Theravada Buddhism, the oldest Buddhist tradition still actively pursued in the 21st century.

We hope you enjoy the app.

May all beings be happy.
